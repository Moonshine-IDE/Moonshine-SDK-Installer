("Apple") for use only under the terms of this License.  Apple and/or Apple’s licensors retain ownership of the Developer Software itself and reserve all rights not expressly granted to you. The terms of this License will govern any software upgrades provided by Apple that replace and/or supplement the original Developer Software, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern. 

B. Title and intellectual property rights in and to any content displayed by or accessed through the Developer Software belongs to the respective content owner. Such content may be protected by copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties, and may be subject to terms of use of the third party providing such content. This License does not grant you any rights to use such content nor does it guarantee that such content will continue to be available to you.

2. Permitted License Uses and Restrictions.
A. License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you are granted a limited, non-exclusive license to use the Developer Software on Apple-branded computers to develop and test application and other software. You may make only as many internal use copies of the Developer Software as reasonably necessary to use the Developer Software as permitted under this License and distribute such copies only to your employees whose job duties require them to so use the Developer Software; provided that you reproduce on each copy of the Developer Software or portion thereof, all copyright or other proprietary notices contained on the original. 

B. Other Use Restrictions. The grants set forth in this License do not permit you to, and you agree not to, install, use or run the Developer Software on any non-Apple-branded computer, or to enable others to do so. Except as otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this License or as otherwise licensed by Apple: (i) only one user may use the Developer Software at a time, and (ii) you may not make the Developer Software available over a network where it could be run or used by multiple computers at the same time. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, sublicense or otherwise redistribute the Developer Software or exploit any services provided by or through the Developer Software in any unauthorized way. 

C. No Reverse Engineering; Limitations. You may not, and you agree not to or to enable others to, copy (except as expressly permitted by this License), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, decrypt, modify, create derivative works of the Developer Software or any services provided by or through the Developer Software or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by licensing terms governing use of the  Open-Sourced Components or Sample Code). 

D. Sample Code. Certain portions of the Developer Software consist of sample or example code provided by Apple ("Sample Code"). You may use, reproduce, modify and redistribute such Sample Code only in accordance with the licensing terms accompanying such Sample Code or related project(s).

E. QuickTime Development Software. You may use the QuickTime development software only to develop application software that is compatible with, and runs only on supported OS X and/or Windows platforms with QuickTime installed. Your software application may not interfere with the functionality of QuickTime Player or the QuickTime Plug-in, including but not limited to file type or MIME type associations that are registered to QuickTime.

F. Use of System-Provided Images. The system-provided images owned by Apple and documented as such in Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for OS X and iOS ("System-Provided Images") are licensed to you solely for the purpose of developing OS X and iOS applications, respectively, using the Developer Software. Upon termination of this License, you may continue to distribute the System-Provided Images as used within software you developed using the Developer Software; however, you agree to provide to Apple, at Apple's request, a copy of any software you developed using the Developer Software that incorporates any of the System-Provided Images so Apple may determine, in its sole discretion, whether your use of the System-Provided Images complies with these terms.

G. Location Services; Consents. 
1. Apple may enable you to access certain location-based application programming interfaces (APIs) (e.g., Core Location) documented by Apple (“Location APIs”) through the Developer Software.  Subject to these terms and conditions, you may use such APIs and services only to enable software programs you develop for use on OS X (“Applications”) to access location data (e.g. the real-time geographic location of a user’s computer) from users who consent to such access. For Applications that use Location APIs or otherwise provide location-based services, you agree that such Applications may not be designed or marketed for automatic or autonomous control of vehicle behavior, or for emergency or life-saving purposes. In addition, Applications that offer location-based services or functionality must notify and obtain consent from an individual before his or her location data is collected, transmitted or otherwise used by the Application. For Applications that use Location APIs for real-time navigation (including, but not limited to, turn-by-turn route guidance and other routing that is enabled through the use of a sensor), you must have an end-user license agreement that includes the following notice: YOUR USE OF THIS REAL TIME ROUTE GUIDANCE APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. LOCATION DATA MAY NOT BE ACCURATE.

2. You agree that neither you nor your Applications will disable, override or otherwise interfere with any Apple-implemented system alerts, warnings, display panels, consent panels and the like, including, but not limited to, those that are intended to notify the user that the user's location data is being collected, transmitted, maintained, processed or used, or intended to obtain consent for such use.  If consent is denied or withdrawn, neither you nor your Applications may collect, transmit, maintain, process or utilize the user's location information or data through the Location APIs. You understand and agree that you and your Applications must comply with all applicable criminal, civil and statutory laws and regulations (including privacy, data collection and location service laws and regulations) in any jurisdictions in which your Applications may be delivered.  You shall be solely responsible for, and Apple shall have no responsibility or liability whatsoever with respect to, any and all claims, suits, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses arising from, related or attributable to, or otherwise involving your Application, including but not limited to your Application’s use of the Location APIs.

H. Compliance with Laws. You agree to use the Developer Software and the services in compliance with all applicable laws, including local laws of the country or region in which you reside or in which you download or use the Developer Software or services.

3. Transfer. You may make a one-time permanent transfer of all of your license rights to the Developer Software (in its original form as provided by Apple) to another party, provided that: (a) the transfer must include all of the Developer Software, including all its component parts and this License; (b) you do not retain any copies of the Developer Software, full or partial, including copies stored on a computer or other storage device; and (c) the party receiving the Developer Software accepts the terms and conditions of this License. You may not transfer any Developer Software that has been modified or replaced under Section 13 below. All components of the Developer Software are provided as part of a bundle and may not be separated from the bundle and distributed as standalone applications.

4. Consent to Use of Data.
A. Diagnostic and Usage Data. If you choose to allow diagnostic and usage collection, you agree that Apple and its subsidiaries and agents may collect, maintain, process and use diagnostic, technical, usage and related information, including but not limited to unique system or hardware identifiers, information about your computer, system and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to provide and improve Apple’s products and services, facilitate the provision of software updates, product support and other services to you (if any) related to the Developer Software, and to verify compliance with the terms of this License. You may change your preferences for Diagnostics & Usage collection at any time by going to the Diagnostics & Usage setting on your computer and deselecting the checkbox. The Diagnostics & Usage setting is found in the Security & Privacy pane within System Preferences. Apple may use this information, as long as it is collected in a form that does not personally identify you, for the purposes described above. To enable Apple’s partners and third party developers to improve their software, hardware and services designed for use with Apple products, Apple may also provide any such partner or third party developer with a subset of diagnostic information that is relevant to that partner’s or developer’s software, hardware and/or services, as long as the diagnostic information is in a form that does not personally identify you. 

B. Privacy Policy. At all times your information will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by reference into this License and can be viewed at: http://www.apple.com/privacy/.

5. Services; Mac Developer Program.
A. Apple may provide access to services by or through the Developer Software for you to use.  Use of these services may require an Apple ID, may require you to accept additional terms and may be subject to additional fees. If you elect to use such services in conjunction with the Developer Software, your usage of such services will be subject to those additional terms and conditions (e.g., your use of Developer IDs obtained from your Apple Developer Program account will be subject to the applicable Apple Developer Program terms for Developer IDs), but this License will continue to apply to your use of the Developer Software licensed hereunder. If you would like to submit Applications you develop to the Mac App Store, then you must apply to join the Mac Developer Program. More information about Apple’s Developer Programs is available at http://developer.apple.com/. Apple reserves the right to refuse admission to any of its Developer Programs at any time in its sole discretion. 

B. You agree that the services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Apple and its licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, and that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials in any way whatsoever except for permitted use of the services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Apple. Except to the extent expressly permitted in the applicable terms for the services, You agree not to reproduce, modify, rent, lease, lend, sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit the services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the services to transmit any malware, or by trespass or burdening network capacity. 

C. In addition, services that may be accessed, linked to or displayed by or through the Developer Software may not be available in all languages or in all countries. Apple makes no representation that any such services would be appropriate or available for use in any particular location. Apple reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any services at any time. In no event will Apple be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to any such services or for any updates, maintenance, warranty, technical or other support for such services. Apple may also impose limits or other restrictions on the use of or access to the services, in any case without notice or liability.  You acknowledge and agree that Apple reserves the right to revoke or remove your access to any services provided by or through the Developer Software at any time in its sole discretion.

6. Termination. This License is effective until terminated. Your rights under this License will terminate automatically or cease to be effective without notice from Apple if you fail to comply with any term(s) of this License. In addition, Apple reserves the right to terminate this License if a new version of Apple's operating system software or the Developer Software is released which is incompatible with this version of the Developer Software. Upon the termination of this License, you shall cease all use of the Developer Software and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Developer Software. Section 2B, 2C, 4, 5B, and 6 through 13 of this License shall survive any termination.
